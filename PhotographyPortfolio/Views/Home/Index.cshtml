 <p>I started my journey into photography when I first picked up my camera at 14 years old, 16 years ago. I fell in love the moment I developed my first photo.</p>
    <p>For the first 14 years I strictly used film and primarly black and white film. I love how raw film looks, almost capturing the moment like an image you hold in your head. 
        Two years ago, I ventured into the digital realm. 
        The instant gratification of seeing a photo as soon as it's been shot was addicting.</p>

    <p><i>I hope you enjoy not only my photos, but all my memories attached to them.</i></p>
